                <p>Hi, I am Luca Fornasari, a Digital Arts Student studying at the University of Witwaterstrand.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is my Project website for Interactive Media 3, WSOA3029A. The theme for our second semester
                    project
                    is
                    the
                    visualistation of data on the Web. In this website I will be making use of a Covid-19 API where i
                    use
                    data
                    to create graphs to better visualize the data and display it in a way that it is easily readable by
                    the viewer of my website.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In todays modern world there is unfathomable ammounts of data being sent across the web every minute,
                    with
                    such
                    vast ammounts of data humanity could never even dream of analising it all by themselves, this is
                    where
                    data
                    visualisation comes into play. By using visual ways such as charts to plot this data, everyday
                    people
                    have
                    easy
                    access to the data and an easy understanding of what that data represents. This visualisation of
                    data is
                    what
                    will allow our species as a whole to become smarter and develope quicker. With nearly everyone in
                    the
                    world
                    having access to a smartphone data visualisation becomes even more important, providing people even
                    in
                    remote
                    locations of the world with access to information by the touch of a button.</p>

                <h2 class="orange">Style Sheet</h2>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>While designing the website's wireframe and the colours used the fact that around 300 million people
                    in
                    the world are colour blind became apparent. The design of the site was specific towards this, with
                    the
                    nav bar being in a solid close to black colour with white text, this makes the text easily readable
                    if
                    someone is colour blind. The body of the website is also designed in this way, with the background
                    of
                    the body being a light green and pink gradient colour with dark black text, this makes it easier to
                    read for a
                    colourblind
                    person because of the difference between the light background in contrast with the dark text making
                    it easily identifyable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The colours of the website that were chosen are vibrant light greens and light pinks for the
                    background of the website, these
                    colours fade into eachother making the background interesting, this vibrant background mixed
                    with
                    the dark black writing makes the site easily readable. The design of the nav bar differs with a
                    darker
                    background with white writing for the logo of the website and the nav link elements.
                    For the
                    sections of the website that have large ammounts of text on it i have added a larger space between
                    the sentences which helps with the reader easily keep track of where they are and i have found that
                    it reduces
                    the
                    ammount to times that my eyes skip words.</p>

                <p>The above image shows the wireframe of the website while being viewed on desktop resolution and the
                    wireframe while being viewed on a mobile device. While in mobile view mode
                    the
                    nav links at the top of the page dissapear into a toggleable menu that slides out giving the viewer
                    of
                    the website an easy way to navigate and allows the content of the website to be competely visable
                    while
                    the menu toggle is not activated. The above wireframe images show the layout of the respective html
                    pages that make up the website, the landing page layout focuses on the displaying of multiple images
                    acting as nav-links that can be used to navigate to the various sections of the website. nav-links
                    to the different blog posts are positioned at the top of the blog post page for ease of navigation.
                    Responsive
                    design while
                    creating websites is of the utmost
                    importance,
                    especially in Africa where majority of people use their phones to access the internet.
                    i have incorperated many different styles for each of my pages on the site.</p>
