        <article class="Blog1">
            <h2 class="orange">Representation Blog Post</h2>
            <br>

            <p>The author discusses various theories of representation through 5 points or headings of
                discussion.
                She
                starts out with the quote ‘We live immersed in representation: it is how we understand our
                environment
                and
                each other. It is also as we both are, and hos we understand ourselves; representation is
                implicated
                in
                the
                process of becoming me’, and goes on to explain this by firstly looking at representation and
                reality.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> reality is made up of codes and signs communicated through media and cultural texts to shape our
                perceptions and how the reader attaches meaning to what is communicated. To do this, she refers
                to
                Semiotics
                based on the ideas of Ferdinand De Saussure and Charles Saunders Pierce. This is essentially the
                study
                of
                signs and how people read them. Signs being any gesture, sound or image (the signifier) that
                communicates
                something and what that sign is meant to represent to the audience (the signified). What the
                sign
                represents
                can have different meanings depending on the cultures or social groups and the context.
                Therefore
                ‘representation is the way meaning is given to the things depicted through images or words…but
                does
                reality
                have any essential fixed or true meaning.’ (Stuart Hall 1997, Definition of Representation). So
                in
                decoding
                represented reality, we should remember context, bias, filter and frame, our own and that of
                others,
                that
                make up and shape codes that we use to give meaning.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The second point of discussion is representation and myth. The author gives the example of the
                Apple
                logo
                where the reader can understand it in one of 2 ways; denotation or connotation. An apple is just
                an
                apple
                (denotation) but the Apple logo suggests expensive, desirable, slick etc (connotation). We
                recognise
                the
                significance because it is so widespread in the media and advertising that we hardly even
                realise
                it.
                This,
                according to Barthes (1957), is the making of the myth. Another example is stereotyping. The
                author
                gives
                the exmple of how the East or Orient is portrayed over and over in the media and in films as
                being
                ‘exotic’
                or ‘backward’ to a Western culture audience who have no first-hand experience of Eastern culture
                and
                we
                come
                to accept the myth through the layers of signs and codes making up our maps of meaning of the
                world
                and
                our
                understanding of it. So representation is open to distortion, bias and misrepresentation.</p>
            <br>
            <p> third point of discussion is representation and visual communication. Images without text or
                context
                can
                be interpreted in a number of ways and are especially susceptable to the emotional and cultural
                association
                that the image carries. This can be positive for some and negative for others and is seen
                particularly
                in
                advertising where established associations are used to put a point across to a target audience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The fourth point of discussion is representation and persuasion. For example a newspaper article
                where
                images are seen in relation to other images and with text to give a particular version of
                reality.
                Our
                perception of the image is also affected by our own bias and experinece of the world, it is not
                an
                objective
                reality. These days visual representation is widespread and incorporates images, symbols, text
                and
                graphs,
                which can all be presented in a way to get a desired effect on society. A photo or image can be
                manipulated
                by digital technology, framing, point of view and lighting depending on the story the media or
                advertiser
                wants to construct to persuade us over to their view. The question arises what is the real story
                when
                the
                data can be speculative but is presented as legitimate through subtle associations of cultural
                codes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The fifth point of discussion is representation and identity politics. Representation of social
                groups
                according to race, gender, creed, political affiliation,class, age and sexuality can be
                derrogatory
                and
                negative, for example black people are over represented as the baddies in movies. There is
                embedded
                human
                bias particularly in the media, which makes them very powerful in terms of public persuasion in
                all
                areas of
                representation.

            <h2 class="orange">Historic Data Visualisation Blog Post</h2>
            <br>

            <br>
            <div class="img1"><img src="/Edmond Halley (1656–1742) representation of contour lines on a map.jpeg"
                    alt="Edmund Halley (1656-1742) image" width="300" height="300"></div>
            <br>
            <p>This historic data visualization was created by Edmond halley. He developed and created the
                contour
                line
                map that is widely used to this day as a way of explaining and describing the different weather
                that
                places around the world experience. These contour lines are joined by places of equal height on
                the
                map,
                these lines are able to show things such as the gradient of an area on a flat 2D map, if they
                are
                close
                together they represent a steep gradient and if they are far away from each other they represent
                a
                gentle gradient. Edmonds development of this way of representing height on a flat 2D map was
                unbelievably important in paving the way to understand the weather and world around us. By
                making
                the
                graph simple and easy to read by making the concept of the graph simple to understand – places
                with
                equal height are joined. Without Edmonds developments in this way of displaying large amounts of
                real-world tridimensional data on a bidimensional map we would not be able to theorize many of
                the
                explanations for weather formations and more importantly it allows us to predict things like the
                height
                of an area which leads us to explain and predict weather conditions of a certain area with
                relative
                ease. It is important for a person looking at the graph of contours to know what the contours
                actually
                represent, otherwise the graph would be near useless to people that don’t know what the lines
                mean.
                This
                highlights the importance of simple, clear and concise information that is easily understandable
                by
                everyone. To someone who has never seen a map before the representation is useless but to
                someone
                who
                knows how to interpret that information it becomes a powerful tool that can be used. </p>

            <h2 class="orange">Data-driven Storytelling Blog Post</h2>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Visualization researchers show that explanation and exploration can be complimentary in data
                driven
                storytelling and that this opens up new avenues in terms of ‘design, engagement, discovery and
                narrative
                devices’. Previously, ‘exploration’ allowed reader to assemble their own conclusions from
                analysis
                of
                the data presented and, what was considered opposite to this, that ‘explanation’ of visual data
                is
                communicacted from the viewpoint of the author and therefore has the author’s inherent bias.</p>
            <br>
            <p> give a number of characteristics of exploration. It allows the viewer to access extra data on
                what is being presented so reader can come their own conclusions according to their own
                knowledge
                and
                interests. Exploration data-driven stories give the reader a number of different representations
                by
                pre-selecting data attributes and static representations, where viewer asks himself questions
                regarding
                the data presented and allows for his own interpretation. Another characteristic of the
                exploration
                driven data story is the interactive capabilities where different aspects of the data can be
                investigated.</p>
            <br>

            <p> of explanation include the direct or indirect presence of the author directing the
                interpretation of the story. Another characteristic is that selected visuals and text are used
                to
                emphasize what the author wants you to see from the given data set. Explanatory elements include
                headlines, visual clips, long form text and linear sequence to support the author’s viewpoint,
                thereby
                guiding your interpretation. Another characteristic is that these explanations can be obvious or
                subtle,
                either way the author purposely chooses what to show and how to show specific information to
                communicate
                his viewpoint.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Data-driven visual stories more often have both explanatory elements and exploratory elements by
                offering flexibility to the reader alongside the author’s interpretation. This is seen is the
                flexibility of the ‘view’ of the story where many different separate viewpoints of the same data
                set
                are
                offered, in the flexibility of the ‘focus’ where complex static visualization allows
                viewer/reader
                to
                investigate subsets that attract their attention and in the flexibility of the sequence or order
                of
                the
                interactive visualisations through scrolling buttons and panning/zooming ability so
                viewer/reader
                can
                jump across the story in any order. So explanation and exploration can be quite complimentatry
                if
                used
                in balance in a data-driven story and don’t have to be either or. This opens new opportunities
                for
                new
                and engaging types of storytelling.
