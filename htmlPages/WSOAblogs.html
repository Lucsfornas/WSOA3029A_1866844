            <h2 class="orange">Representation Blog Post</h2>
            <br>

            <p>The author discusses various theories of representation through 5 points or headings of
                discussion.
                She
                starts out with the quote ‘We live immersed in representation: it is how we understand our
                environment
                and
                each other. It is also as we both are, and hos we understand ourselves; representation is
                implicated
                in
                the
                process of becoming me’, and goes on to explain this by firstly looking at representation and
                reality.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Reality is made up of codes and signs communicated through media and cultural texts to shape our
                perceptions and how the reader attaches meaning to what is communicated. To do this, she refers
                to
                Semiotics based on the ideas of Ferdinand De Saussure and Charles Saunders Pierce. This is essentially
                the
                study
                of
                signs and how people read them. Signs being any gesture, sound, or image (the signifier) that
                communicates something and what that sign is meant to represent to the audience (the signified). What
                the sign represents can have different meanings depending on the cultures or social groups and the
                context.
                Therefore
                ‘representation is the way meaning is given to the things depicted through images or words…but
                does
                reality
                have any essential fixed or true meaning.’ (Stuart Hall 1997, Definition of Representation). So
                in
                decoding
                the represented reality, we should remember context, bias, filter and frame, our own and that of
                others,
                that
                makeup and shape codes that we use to give meaning.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The second point of discussion is representation and myth. The author gives the example of the
                Apple
                logo
                where the reader can understand it in one of 2 ways; denotation or connotation. An apple is just
                an
                apple
                (denotation) but the Apple logo suggests expensive, desirable, slick, etc (connotation). We
                recognise
                the
                significance because it is so widespread in the media and advertising that we hardly even
                realise
                it.
                This,
                according to Barthes (1957), is the making of the myth. Another example is stereotyping. The
                author
                gives
                the example of how the East or Orient is portrayed over and over in the media and films as
                being
                ‘exotic’
                or ‘backward’ to a Western culture audience who have no first-hand experience of Eastern culture
                and
                we
                come
                to accept the myth through the layers of signs and codes making up our maps of the meaning of the
                world
                and
                our
                understanding of it. So representation is open to distortion, bias, and misrepresentation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The third point of discussion is the representation and visual communication. Images without text or
                context
                can
                be interpreted in several ways and are especially susceptible to the emotional and cultural
                association
                that the image carries. This can be positive for some and negative for others and is seen
                particularly
                in
                advertising where established associations are used to put a point across to a target audience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> The fourth point of discussion is representation and persuasion. For example a newspaper article
                where
                images are seen in relation to other images and with text to give a particular version of
                reality.
                Our
                perception of the image is also affected by our own bias and experience of the world, it is not
                an
                objective
                reality. These days visual representation is widespread and incorporates images, symbols, text
                and
                graphs,
                which can all be presented in a way to get the desired effect on society. A photo or image can be
                manipulated
                by digital technology, framing, point of view, and lighting depending on the story the media or
                advertiser
                wants to construct to persuade us over to their view. The question arises what is the real story
                when
                the
                data can be speculative but is presented as legitimate through subtle associations of cultural
                codes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> The fifth point of discussion is representation and identity politics. Representation of social
                groups
                according to race, gender, creed, political affiliation, class, age and sexuality can be
                derogatory
                and
                negative, for example, black people are over represented as the baddies in movies. There is
                embedded
                human
                bias particularly in the media, which makes them very powerful in terms of public persuasion in
                all
                areas of
                representation.

            <div class="imgedmondhalley">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>This historic data visualization was created by Edmond Halley. He developed and created the
                contour
                line
                map that is widely used to this day as a way of explaining and describing the different weather
                that
                places around the world experience. These contour lines are joined by places of equal height on
                the
                map,
                these lines can show things such as the gradient of an area on a flat 2D map, if they
                are
                close
                together they represent a steep gradient and if they are far away from each other they represent
                a
                gentle gradient. Edmonds development of this way of representing height on a flat 2D map was
                unbelievably important in paving the way to understand the weather and the world around us. By
                making
                the
                graph simple and easy to read by making the concept of the graph simple to understand – places
                with
                equal height are joined. Without Edmonds developments in this way of displaying large amounts of
                real-world tridimensional data on a bidimensional map we would not be able to theorize many of
                the
                explanations for weather formations and more importantly it allows us to predict things like the
                height
                of an area which leads us to explain and predict weather conditions of a certain area with
                relative
                ease. It is important for a person looking at the graph of contours to know what the contours
                actually
                represent, otherwise, the graph would be near useless to people that don’t know what the lines
                mean.
                This
                highlights the importance of simple, clear, and concise information that is easily understandable
                by
                everyone. To someone who has never seen a map before the representation is useless but to
                someone
                who
                knows how to interpret that information it becomes a powerful tool that can be used. </p>

            <h2 class="orange">Data-driven Storytelling Blog Post</h2>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Visualization researchers show that explanation and exploration can be complimentary in data
                driven
                storytelling and that this opens up new avenues in terms of ‘design, engagement, discovery and
                narrative
                devices’. Previously, ‘exploration’ allowed the reader to assemble their own conclusions from
                analysis
                of
                the data presented and, what was considered opposite to this, that ‘explanation’ of visual data
                is
                communicated from the viewpoint of the author and therefore has the author’s inherent bias.</p>
            <br>
            <p> This gives several characteristics of exploration. It allows the viewer to access extra data on
                what is being presented so the reader can come to their conclusions according to their own
                knowledge
                and
                interests. Exploration data-driven stories give the reader several different representations
                by
                pre-selecting data attributes and static representations, where the viewer asks himself questions
                regarding
                the data presented and allows for his own interpretation. Another characteristic of the
                exploration
                driven data story is the interactive capabilities where different aspects of the data can be
                investigated.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The explanation includes the direct or indirect presence of the author directing the interpretation of
                the story. Another characteristic is that selected visuals and text are used to emphasize what the
                author wants you to see from the given data set. Explanatory elements include
                headlines, visual clips, long-form text, and linear sequence to support the author’s viewpoint,
                thereby
                guiding your interpretation. Another characteristic is that these explanations can be obvious or
                subtle,
                either way, the author purposely chooses what to show and how to show specific information to
                communicate
                his viewpoint.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Data-driven visual stories more often have both explanatory elements and exploratory elements by offering
                flexibility to the reader alongside the author’s interpretation. This is seen is the flexibility of the
                ‘view’ of the story where many different separate viewpoints of the same data set are offered, in the
                flexibility of the ‘focus’ where complex static visualization allows viewer/reader to investigate
                subsets that attract their attention and in the flexibility of the sequence or order of the interactive
                visualizations through scrolling buttons and panning/zooming ability so viewer/reader can jump across
                the story in any order. So explanation and exploration can be quite complementary if used in balance in
                a data-driven story and don’t have to be either-or. This opens new opportunities for new and engaging
                types of storytelling.

            <h2 class="orange">Critical Reflection on my data visualisation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In this blog post, I will be reflecting on my own data visualizations and why they have been represented
                in the way that they have been.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On my website, I have 4 data visualizations of all different shapes and sizes, from dots to donut charts.
                Information is a powerful tool that can be used in many different ways, people can use it for good and
                for bad. But the way information is conveyed and displayed to people is integral to the way people
                understand it. I have learnt that the way that information is displayed can change the way people
                perceive what is being shown to them. An example of this is in my extra data visualization made using
                chart.js libraries. In the chart, different bars are displayed showing the statistics of the covid-19
                global pandemic. The bar displaying ‘confirmed’ can be misread very easily. The confirmed bar might
                scare people into thinking that there are way more cases than there actually are, the bar actually
                represents the total number of cases, this includes all of the other bars being added together to get
                this total. This, while not intentional, is a good example of how information can be manipulated into
                misleading people to believe things that aren’t really true. I have chosen to keep the graph this way as
                an example of bad data visualization techniques.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my other visualizations, I have used various other ways of representing data, my first data
                representation is quite simple as it was a practice graph to learn about d3. But in most cases, the more
                simplistic a graph is, the easier it is to understand by the viewer. The second and third data
                visualizations are more complex. The second is an interactable bar chart visualization showing that the
                more engaging and interactable a graph is the more attention people pay to it because they can change
                certain aspects about it, in this graph I have made a function that will hide the bar(s) that you select
                making It easier to compare the data being represented. The third data visualization is more colorful
                and fun, it takes the covid-19 data and represents it differently, this way is as a donut chart. These
                charts are mainly used for displaying information that is part of a whole or in simple terms the
                percentage out of 100. In the case of this donut chart, the total number of cases is 100% and the other
                statistics add together to get this number. This shows visually how each of the statistics (active,
                critical, death, and recovered) make up the whole total number of confirmed cases.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All in all, information visualization is a powerful tool that allows people to quickly analyses facts
                about a situation, for example, the covid-19 statistics. These representations can be used unethically
                or ethically by the people that create them, this highlights the importance of correct data
                visualization so that it is not misleading to people who see them.</p>

            <p>Algorithms are a type of automated reasoning, like following a recipe, but what if an ingredient is

                algorithms are, to what extent errors can occur…. and whether we can detect such errors’. Imagine if it
                is an algorithm that decides if you get a home loan or not and if the bank clerk tells you he doesn’t
                know why you didn’t get the home loan, the algorithm decided that based on your Data Profile.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A data profile is generated through algorithms that collect information on a user through various data
                streams on the technology the user frequents for example your Google searches, your WhatsApp chats, the
                news publications you read, and the places you frequent. This data then interacts with other data
                systems that give a probability analysis of the user. The value of this information about a user is seen
                in targeted adverts in our media streams. The algorithm can predict your political views before an
                election and predict your health outcome. In a ‘Hyperconnected’ world, the algorithm will know you
                better than you know yourself.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Liisa Janssens questions the impact of categorizing humans through data profiling has on human freedom
                and are we reduced to ‘packages of data’. There are privacy provisions in the Apps we use but there are
                glaring ethical questions that have arisen about the use of our personal data and the way it is
                collected. Does the user have access to the information used in his data profile and can the user have
                the opportunity to correct errors or argue their point of view on assumptions made by the algorithms.
                Also, who is responsible for the accuracy of big data processes. Does responsibility lie with the
                organization that analyses the data or collects the data or perhaps the programmer of the algorithm,
                especially when many organizations have access to these databases. When businesses use this data profile
                as opposed to a human customer, people are reduced to objects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Perhaps all designers and programmers of algorithms should take a course in Philosophy and Psychology and
                should consider ethical and moral responsibilities in designing algorithms.</p>

            <h2 class="orange">Information is Beautiful - Ethical Implications Blog Post</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In this blog post, I will be analyzing the 'what is trillions' visualization from information is
                beautiful.net. This visualization shows the largest amounts of money that are generated around the
                world, hence the name trillions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When looking at the visualization it is split into different sized boxes that represent the amount of
                money, visually it is suggested that the bigger the block presented the bigger the monetary value.
                However, these blocks hide the fact that 1 trillion dollars is a massive quantity of money, with this in
                mind the smallest value on the page is 1.2 trillion dollars and the largest is at 158 trillion dollars.
                These blocks are successful in representing the sheer scale of money that is being depicted with the
                smallest block and the largest block being greatly different is scale. The title also gives us the
                viewers of the visualization a clue to what it is measured in by having a dollar sign before the
                trillions, this leads us to believe that it is measured in dollars. The coloration of the blocks also
                aids us in identifying and understanding these block visualizations, with the smaller blocks that are
                around 10 trillion in value having the color yellow this then changes as the blocks increase in size and
                value, they then start to change color to an orange-like color as they grow. These blocks then change
                color to a redder type of orange color as they get larger than 73 trillion, and then finally the largest
                block of the visualization is depicted in red, this is 158 trillion- the total wealth of the 1% of the
                world’s top earners.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Representations however could be misleading to individuals if not represented correctly, at first the
                viewer only pays attention to the size and color of the blocks, by changing the size and color of the
                blocks they could mislead a reader to think that they are smaller than they actually are not presenting
                the right information. We already see how the smallest block on the page can make a trillion dollars
                look like nothing when it’s a great sum of money. Ethically the right thing to do is to display the
                blocks correctly with the color and size being equal to the quantity of money they represent, which is
                what the information is beautiful visualization has done perfectly. It is evident that even one mistake
                in size or color could manipulate a person into believing that the value is smaller than it is, for
                example – if the largest of the blocks and the smallest was in a green color we would think as viewers
                that they are the same because of the largest and smallest being the same color. This visualization only
                highlights the ethical implications that are involved when creating visualizations of this standard and
                that the right representational and communicative strategies should be used in the creation of the
                visualization.</p>

            <h2 class="orange">Exam Blog Post - Reflection on Interactive Data Driven Work</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In this exam blog post, I will reflect on my interactive data-driven artwork. The main focus of this post
                will be to reflect on interactivity and the creation of meaning while addressing interesting parallels
                between the data sets. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Interactive data driven-artwork as a whole is a very useful tool in today’s digital world, taking large
                amounts of data that would otherwise be impossible to work through and analyze and displaying it
                visually on a graph to make it easier to draw meaning from the data. In my exam data visualization I
                take two datasets and compare them, the first set is the number of people living in each province in
                South Africa, this is then compared to the covid-19 dataset of how many cases are in the province and
                then the number of deaths per province. This is further enhanced by the interactivity of the graph, by
                adding buttons that switch the datasets from one to another this allows the close analysis of how each
                province has been affected during the pandemic.</p>
            <br>
            <p> This allows us to visually see the relationship between the population of a province and how it is
                affected, an example of this is the first column representing Gauteng Province (GP) where we see that it
                has the largest population out of all provinces, by switching the dataset to cases we see how the
                largest population has the most cases of covid-19 and the most deaths out of all provinces. we can
                further deduct from this data that Gauteng is the most likely place that a person will contract covid-19
                due to its greater population density. I wish to further, through this visualization, reinforce the
                easily deductible facts – the greater the population the greater the chance of a serious outbreak.
                Though this visualization can be seen as slightly daunting to some, I believe that this is good, acting
                as a wakeup call for people to exercise greater caution and improve their habits of sanitation and mask
                protection. This ties in with my blog post on representation where we see the fact that “Images are seen
                in relation to other images and with text give a particular vision of reality.”.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This graphs interactivity is necessary for displaying this data because the datasets we are comparing
                have a vast difference in range with the population per province being in the millions and the deaths
                being in the thousands, to put these two sets of data on the same scale would mean that we would not be
                able to see the relationship of the deaths because the scale of the graph would be too big, that is why
                I have incorporated a dynamic changing scale to better quantify each dataset. By adding an aspect of
                interactivity it also forces the engagement of the viewer with the visualization, allowing for a better,
                more captivating experience and understanding of the various datasets. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I have specifically used a line graph to represent this data because it better visually illustrates the
                comparative difference between the different provinces. This better communicates the change from
                province to province, with the provinces being arranged on the x-axis in descending order of population
                we can further see how each province has been affected by the pandemic.</p>
