        <p>Hi, I am Luca Fornasari, a Digital Arts Student studying at the University of Witwaterstrand.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is my Project website for Interactive Media 3, WSOA3029A. The theme for our second semester project is
            the
            visualistation of data on the Web. In this website I will be making use of a Covid-19 API where i use that
            data
            to create graphs to better visualize the data.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In todays modern world there is unfathomable ammounts of data being sent across the web every minute, with
            such
            vast ammounts of data humanity could never even dream of analising it all by themselves, this is where data
            visualisation comes into play. By using visual ways such as charts to plot this data, everyday people have
            easy
            access to the data and an easy understanding of what that data represents. This visualisation of data is
            what
            will allow our species as a whole to become smarter and develope quicker. With nearly everyone in the world
            having access to a smartphone data visualisation becomes even more important, providing people even in
            remote
            locations of the world with access to information by the touch of a button.</p>
