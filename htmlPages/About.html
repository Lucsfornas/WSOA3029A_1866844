            <p>Hi, I am Luca Fornasari, a Digital Arts Student studying at the University of Witwaterstrand.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is my Project website for Interactive Media 3, WSOA3029A. The theme for our second semester project
                is
                the
                visualistation of data on the Web. In this website I will be making use of a Covid-19 API where i use
                that
                data
                to create graphs to better visualize the data.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In todays modern world there is unfathomable ammounts of data being sent across the web every minute,
                with
                such
                vast ammounts of data humanity could never even dream of analising it all by themselves, this is where
                data
                visualisation comes into play. By using visual ways such as charts to plot this data, everyday people
                have
                easy
                access to the data and an easy understanding of what that data represents. This visualisation of data is
                what
                will allow our species as a whole to become smarter and develope quicker. With nearly everyone in the
                world
                having access to a smartphone data visualisation becomes even more important, providing people even in
                remote
                locations of the world with access to information by the touch of a button.</p>

        <h2 class="orange">Style Sheet</h2>
        <br>
        <main class="box">
            <br>
            <p>While designing the website's wireframe and the colours used the fact that around 300 million people in
                the world are colour blind became apparent. The design of the site was specific towards this, with the
                nav bar being in a solid close to black colour with white text, this makes the text easily readable if
                someone is colour blind. The body of the website is also designed in this way, with the background of
                the body being a light red colour with dark blue text, this makes it easier to read for a colourblind
                person because of the difference in the light and dark text making it easily identifyable.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The colours of the website that were chosen are vibrant reds for the background of the website, these
                red colours fade into eachother making the background interesting, this vibrant background mixed with
                the dark blue writing makes the site easily readable. The design of the nav bar differs with a dark
                close to black background with white writing for the logo of the website and the nav link elements. For
                sections of the website that have large ammounts of text on it i have added a border around the
                paragraphs of text which helps with the reader easily keep track and i have found that it reduces the
                ammount to times that my eyes skip words.</p>

        <br>
        <main class="box">
            <br>
            <div class="Wframe"><img src="/wireframe_image.jpg" alt="Wireframe image" width="300" height="300"></div>
            <br>
            <p>The above image shows the wireframe of the website while being viewed on desktop resolution (the
                wireframe above) and the wireframe while being viewed on a mobile device. While in mobile view mode the
                nav links at the top of the page dissapear into a toggleable menu that slides out giving the viewer of
                the website an easy way to navigate and allows the content of the website to be competely visable while
                the menu toggle is not activated. Responsive design while creating websites is of the utmost importance,
                especially in Africa where majority of people use their phones to access the internet.</p>
